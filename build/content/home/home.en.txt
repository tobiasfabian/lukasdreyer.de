    For me, artistic endeavours are
    reminiscent of the type of unencumbered
    play I experienced as a child. The
    freedom and resulting self-confidence I
    experience give me space for creating my
    music. This is why I am so happy to
    always have my cello – an instrument
    capable of so many different sounds –
    as my faithful traveling companion.

    Professionalism unfolds in an atmosphere
    where the love of music co-exists with a
    love for precision. For me, teaching is
    a blend of giving and learning.
    Multi-talented students challenge me to
    become a better instructor, mentor, and
    coach. Closely observing and listening
    to them enriches my own experience.

    My artistic motivation also finds
    expression in initiating projects based
    on cross-genre concepts. Communication
    and organisation, for me, mean the
    ability to be both sender and receiver.
    I find it fascinating to bring together
    a group of enthusiastic people and give
    them space in which to collaborate.

    The language of music is universal in
    its emotional reach. To me, making new
    connections between existing pieces,
    thereby creating space for improvisation
    and the eager invention of new
    possibilities is like a kind of musical
    playground where forms and sounds can be
    discovered.
