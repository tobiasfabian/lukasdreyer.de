In March my ensemble **Freiraum Syndikat** was invited by **Moritz Eggert** to play a concert at the Milla Club in Munic. It was broadcasted by BR "live on air". We played a program with a lot of songs of the beggar's opera, dances and arrangements . The unique instrumentation with Cello, jazz guitar and Baroque flutes was inspiring the composer to write new songs in the tradition of famous examples like "Dreigroschen Oper" by Kurt Weill. 
This new program was a further **milestone** to present  the idea of a second program beside "Strange Meeting" for Freiraum Syndikat in a cooperation with Moritz Eggert.
